> Yet Another Game Of Life Implementation

Just for fun.


Features
--------

  * Infinite 2D world.
  * Configurable rules.
  * (Maybe) extendable to more dimensions.
  * No (or not yet) display interface.
    - It just calculates the coordinates of each generation alive cells.
    - We may add other information such as world boundaries (outside which
      there are no living cells).
